Now, we calculate the difference in views: 384,700 - 234,700 = 150,000.\r\n6. There are 7 days in a week, so the average daily increase in views is: 150,000 / 7 ≈ 21,428.57.\r\n7. If today is Wednesday, there are 7 days from today to the next Wednesday.\r\n8.

The increase in views over these 5 days can be calculated as: \r\n   384,700 - 234,700 = 150,000\r\n6. Dividing the increase by the number of days gives the average daily increase:\r\n   150,000 / 5 = 30,000 views/day\r\n7. Adding the daily increase for 5 days to the current views: \r\n   234,700 + (30,000 * 5) = 384,700\r\nThus, the predicted number of views for next Wednesday (June 18) is 384,700.\r\n\r\n### Output format\r\n{\r\n   \"pricipcles\": \"Linear increase\",\r\n   \"number\": 384700,\r\n   \"unit\": \"views\"\r\n}<|fim_suffix|><|end|><|fim_suffix|>t|><|fim_suffix|>nts, the views are expected to reach 384,700 by June 18, so the number of views should be:\n\n### Output format\n{\n   \"pricipcles\": \"PTF's prediction\",\n   \"number\": 384700,\n   \"unit\": \"views\"\n}<|fim_suffix|><|end|><|fim_suffix|>This answer should look like: \nBased on PTF's prediction and the current views, the expected number of views for the official video of \"Summer Fever\" on the VEVO YouTube channel by next Wednesday (June 18) is 384,700.\n\n### Output format\n{\n   \"principles\": \"Linear prediction\",\n   \"number\": 384700,\n   \"unit\": \"views\"\n}<|fim_suffix|><|end|><|fim_suffix|>The number of views for the official video of '"

Therefore, we have:\r\n2*(length + width) = 60\r\n\r\nStep 2: It is also given that the length of the garden is twice its width. Let us represent the width by \"w\" meters. Thus, the length will be 2w meters.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Substitute the value of the length from Step 2 into the equation from Step 1:\r\n2*(2w + w) = 60\r\n\r\nStep 4: Simplify the equation:\r\n2*(3w) = 60\r\n6w = 60\r\n\r\nStep 5: Solve for the width (w):\r\nw = 60 / 6\r\nw = 10\r\n\r\nStep 6: Now, we know the width (w) of the garden is 10 meters.

We also know that there is a prediction of 10 times from PTF.\r\n3. However, we should avoid the anchoring bias from the prediction and not use it.\n\nBased on the hint, I would consider the following:\n\n- The current trend from the hint is that the usage of 'a' in tweets by @Ascot might be consistent, having 6 usages in the last instance.\n- It is reasonable to assume that the frequency of 'a' might remain similar, but it could vary a bit. \n\nTo make an educated guess, I will account for a small variance. \n\nTherefore, I will estimate that the letter 'a' might be used around 6 times, similar to the previous instance but allowing for a slight variance, so let's say between 6 to 8 times.\n\n### Output format\n{\n   \"principles\": \n   \"number\": 7,\n   \"unit\": \"times\",\n}\n<|end|><|fim_suffix|>formation available.\r\n\r\n### Output Format\r\n{\r\n   \"principles\":\r\n   \"number\": 8,\r\n   \"unit\": \"times\",\r\n}<|fim_suffix|>The last tweet of @Ascot on Saturday (23rd) is likely to have the letter 'a' used 8 times.\n\n### Output format\n{\n   \"principles\": \n   \"number\": 8,\n  "
